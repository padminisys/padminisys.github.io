## Executive Summary: SVN Repository Mirroring Approach (DC to DR)

We propose leveraging Apache Subversion’s native tool **`svnsync`** for mirroring our SVN repositories from the primary Data Center (DC) to the Disaster Recovery (DR) location. This approach provides seamless replication of SVN repository data, ensuring business continuity and minimizing downtime risks.

### Brief Concept:

* **Primary (DC) Repository:** Active SVN repository receiving all user commits.
* **Secondary (DR) Repository:** A passive, read-only replica, continuously synchronized from the primary server.

### Workflow and Setup:

The mirroring setup involves these straightforward steps:

1. **Initialize DR Repository:**

   * Create an empty SVN repository at the DR site.
   * Configure necessary hooks to enable synchronization.

2. **Synchronization Setup:**

   * Run initial synchronization using SVN’s native `svnsync`.
   * Schedule periodic synchronization (typically every few minutes) using automated cron jobs.

3. **Automated Incremental Updates:**

   * Every commit to the DC repository automatically replicates to the DR repository through scheduled synchronization jobs, keeping both repositories in sync.

In case of a DC outage, we swiftly convert the DR repository to active mode, enabling continued SVN operations without significant disruption.

This native SVN-based mirroring solution provides a robust yet straightforward mechanism to ensure continuity, protect critical repository data, and simplify recovery procedures.
