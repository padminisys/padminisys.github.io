The core approach involves:</p> <ol> <li>Automated Snapshots: A scheduled task on the DC machine will capture an encrypted, deduplicated snapshot of the critical data directories every five minutes.</li> <li>Secure Replication: These snapshots will be immediately sent over the network to a secure Restic repository hosted on the DR machine, likely via the SFTP protocol.</li> <li>Efficiency: Restic's content-defined chunking ensures that only new or changed data blocks are transmitted, making the 5-minute interval feasible even over standard network links.</li> <li>Rapid Failover: In a DR event, a simple Restic command executed on the DR machine will restore the latest data snapshot, bringing the machine online with the most recent data.</li> <li>Reversible Roles: The architecture is symmetrical. After a failover, the DR machine can assume the DC role and begin replicating its data back to the original DC (which now serves as the new DR), ensuring business continuity.</li> </ol> <p>Outcome: The result is a cost-effective, secure, and highly automated DR strategy that provides a low Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of approximately 5 minutes and a fast Recovery Time Objective (RTO) limited only by the time to restore the data.</p>"},{"location":"aqm-drdc/win/#brief-implementation-plan","title":"Brief Implementation Plan","text":"<p>This plan details the steps to configure Restic for automated replication and failover.</p>"},{"location":"aqm-drdc/win/#phase-1-initial-setup-one-time","title":"Phase 1: Initial Setup (One-Time)","text":"<ol> <li> <p>On the DR Machine (Repository Host):</p> <ul> <li>Install an SFTP Server: Set up a secure SFTP server (e.g., OpenSSH for Windows or Linux).</li> <li>Create a Backup User: Create a dedicated, non-administrator user account for Restic (e.g., <code>restic-user</code>).</li> <li>Create Repository Directory: Create a folder that will store the backup data (e.g., <code>D:\\restic-repo</code>).
